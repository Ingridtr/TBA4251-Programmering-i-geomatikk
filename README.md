# TBA4251_Programmering_i_geomatikk
I will use a model-driven approach for 3D roof reconstruction to identify and write 3D models of roofs in Trondheim.

\textbf{Input}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Segmented roof point clouds
    \item Building footprints
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output}: LoD2 building models
